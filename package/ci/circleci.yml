  # https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1716 ; started happening on

  # for Docker images:
  #   https://discuss.circleci.com/t/docker-executor-infrastructure-upgrade/52282
  # This manifests when running corrade-rc already:
  #   ThreadSanitizer: unexpected memory mapping 0x7e2f226ae000-0x7e2f22b00000
  # Unfortunately, with Docker images, none of the suggested
  #   sysctl vm.mmap_rnd_bits=28
  #   echo 0 | tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
  # works, complaining about read-only filesystem. The only way to set those is
  # with a real VM instead of Docker, which is what's done here. It also means
  # it's not possible to test on 18.04 anymore as those VMs are no longer
