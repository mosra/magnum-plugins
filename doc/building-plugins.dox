@brief Guide how to download and build plugins for the Magnum engine.

@tableofcontents
@m_footernavigation

Plugins provide additional capability for the Magnum engine in terms of
importing and exporting various media file formats. They are not needed for
essential usage, but you might want them sooner or later when you would want to
use an image as a texture or render text on the screen.

@section building-plugins-packages Prepared packages

The easiest way to install Magnum Plugins is to use one of the ready-made
packages for your platform of choice. See @ref building-plugins-manual if you
want to have more control. Cross-compiling is very similar to
@ref building-cross "cross-compiling of Magnum itself".

-   @ref building-plugins-packages-brew

@subsection building-plugins-packages-vcpkg Vcpkg packages on Windows

Magnum Plugins are available as a [Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
package. See @ref building-packages-vcpkg "the Magnum Vcpkg documentation" for
a more detailed introduction and a troubleshooting guide. Installing latest
stable version of Magnum Plugins with all its dependencies is done like this:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install magnum-plugins
@endcode

But often you may want to install the latest Git revision of all Magnum
projects instead:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install --head corrade magnum magnum-plugins
@endcode

Note that just a subset of plugins is installed by default. To opt-in or
opt-out of additional features, you can use the following syntax; feature names
are simply names of CMake `WITH_*` options from the @ref building-plugins-features
section but lowercase, e.g.:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install magnum-plugins[assimpimporter,ddsimporter]
@endcode

To install all features of a package, use `*`, e.g.:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install magnum-plugins[*]
@endcode

There are also Vcpkg packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-vcpkg "Magnum Integration" and
@ref building-extras-packages-vcpkg "Magnum Extras".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-arch ArchLinux packages

Package for the latest stable release is maintained in the `community` repo.
Installing is as simple as this:

@code{.sh}
sudo pacman -S magnum-plugins
@endcode

In `package/archlinux/magnum-plugins-git` there is a package for Git
development build. The package is also in AUR as
[magnum-plugins-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/magnum-plugins-git/).
It depends on @ref building-corrade-packages-arch "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-arch "Magnum" ArchLinux packages.

There are also a few development packages for native builds, cross-compilation
for Emscripten, Android and MinGW or various sanitizer/coverage builds. See the
PKGBUILD files in the `package/archlinux` directory. They allow you to build
and install the package directly from source tree. Example usage:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins && cd magnum-plugins
cd package/archlinux
makepkg -fp PKGBUILD # or any other PKGBUILD file
@endcode

@note In case of Emscripten, the PKGBUILDs reference a few external
    dependencies such as `emscripten-faad2`, which are not in AUR. You can find
    PKGBUILDs for these in https://github.com/mosra/archlinux. You can also
    edit the package, disable building of affected features and remove the
    dependency.

In most cases the development PKGBUILDs also contain a @cb{.sh} check() @ce
function which will run all unit tests before packaging. That might sometimes
fail or take too long, pass `--nocheck` to `makepkg` to skip that.

Once built, install the package using `pacman`:

@code{.sh}
sudo pacman -U magnum-plugins-*.pkg.tar.xz
@endcode

Edit the PKGBUILDs if you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-plugins-features "enable / disable additional features".

There are also ArchLinux packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-arch "Magnum Integration",
@ref building-extras-packages-arch "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-arch "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-msys MSYS2 packages

[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) package for the latest stable release is
mantained in the official repos. Installing is as simple as this:

@code{.sh}
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-magnum-plugins # or mingw-w64-i686-magnum-plugins
@endcode

Similarly to ArchLinux, there is one package in the
`package/msys/magnum-plugins` directory, which will download and package latest
stable release; and then a development `PKGBUILD` in `package/msys`, allowing
you to package and install the currently checked out source tree. Both depend
on corresponding @ref building-corrade-packages-msys "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-msys "Magnum" MSYS2 packages. Example usage:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins && cd magnum-plugins
cd package/msys
makepkg -fp PKGBUILD
@endcode

The above works in a 32/64bit MinGW shell, from a MSYS shell the equivalent
command is

@code{.sh}
makepkg-mingw -fp PKGBUILD
@endcode

@m_class{m-noindent}

which will build both a 32bit and a 64bit version. See the
[MSYS2 Wiki](https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/Creating-Packages) for more
information.

There are also MSYS2 packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-msys "Magnum Integration".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-deb Packages for Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives

Prebuilt packages of the latest stable version for Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 and
18.04 are available through a PPA. To install packages related to Magnum and
Corrade, you can add the repository and then install the packages with the
following commands:

@code{.sh}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chrome/magnum.graphics
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install magnum-plugins magnum-plugins-dev
@endcode

For more information about these packages, please visit
[the PPA page](https://launchpad.net/~chrome/+archive/ubuntu/magnum.graphics).

To build your own package, the `package/debian/` directory contains all files needed for building Debian packages. You need the
@ref building-corrade-packages-deb "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-deb "Magnum" Debian packages installed and in addition
also the `dpkg-dev` and `debhelper` packages. Building is easy, just change
directory to package root, link or copy the `package/debian` directory there
and run `dpkg-buildpackage`:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins && cd magnum-plugins
ln -s package/debian .
dpkg-buildpackage
@endcode

This will compile binary and development packages, which will then appear in a
parent directory. Install them using `dpkg`:

@code{.sh}
sudo dpkg -i ../magnum-plugins*.deb
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-plugins-features "enable / disable additional features", add them
to `dh_auto_configure` at the bottom of `debian/rules`. Watch out, as
indentation has to be done using tabs, not spaces.

There are also Debian packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-deb "Magnum Integration",
@ref building-extras-packages-deb "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-deb "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-gentoo Gentoo Linux ebuilds

Gentoo Git ebuild is available in the `package/gentoo` directory. Get the
@ref building-corrade-packages-gentoo "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-gentoo "Magnum" Gentoo packages first and then build and
install Magnum Plugins like this:

@code{.sh}
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins && cd magnum-plugins
cd package/gentoo
sudo ebuild dev-libs/magnum-plugins/magnum-plugins-99999.ebuild manifest clean merge
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-plugins-features "enable / disable additional features", add them
to `mycmakeargs` in the `*.ebuild` file.

There are also Gentoo packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-gentoo "Magnum Integration",
@ref building-extras-packages-gentoo "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-gentoo "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-brew Homebrew formulas for macOS

macOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas building the latest Git revision are
in the `package/homebrew` directory. Either use the `*.rb` files directly or
use the tap at https://github.com/mosra/homebrew-magnum. This will install the
latest stable version of Magnum Plugins with all dependencies:

@code{.sh}
brew install mosra/magnum/magnum-plugins
@endcode

But often you may want to install the latest Git revision of all Magnum
projects instead:

@code{.sh}
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/corrade
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-plugins
@endcode

When installing from the `*.rb` files you need to install the
@ref building-corrade-packages-brew "Corrade"
and @ref building-packages-brew "Magnum" Homebrew packages first. If you want
to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-plugins-features "enable / disable additional features", edit the
`*.rb` file.

There are also Homebrew packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-brew "Magnum Integration",
@ref building-extras-packages-brew "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-brew "Magnum Examples".

@section building-plugins-manual Manual build

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins.
Building the plugins is very similar to building Magnum itself. See
@ref building for additonal information about building and running tests,
cross-compiling and platform-specific issues.

@subsection building-plugins-features Enabling or disabling features

Similarly to Magnum, the plugins are build as shared by default. If you are
developing for a platform that doesn't support dynamic library loading or if
you just want to link them statically, enable `BUILD_PLUGINS_STATIC` to build
the plugins as static. If you plan to use the static plugins with shared
libraries later, enable also position-independent code with `BUILD_STATIC_PIC`.
Dynamic plugins are loaded by the manager on request at runtime, potentially
saving memory when the plugin is not needed, static plugins must be linked in
at compile time. Some plugins expose their internal state through separate
libraries, their static build can be controlled using the `BUILD_STATIC`
option.

Static plugins built in the `Debug` configuration (e.g. with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`
set to `Debug`) have a `-d` suffix, *dynamic* plugins in `Debug` configuration
are installed to the `magnum-d` subdirectory, similarly to what is done when
@ref building "building Magnum itself".

By default no plugins are built and you need to select them manually:

Some plugins expose their internal state through separate libraries and you can
control their build separately:

-   `WITH_OPENDDL` --- Build the @ref OpenDdl library. Enabled automatically if
    `WITH_OPENGEXIMPORTER` is enabled.

Note that each plugin class / library namespace documentation contains more
detailed information about its dependencies, availability on particular
platforms and also a guide how to enable given plugin for building and how to
use it with CMake.
