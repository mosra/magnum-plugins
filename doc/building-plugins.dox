Plugins provide additional capability for the Magnum engine in terms of
importing and exporting various media file formats. They are not needed for
essential usage, but you might want them sooner or later when you would want to
use an image as a texture or render text on the screen.

@section building-plugins-packages Prepared packages

The easiest way to install Magnum Plugins is to use one of the ready-made
packages for your platform of choice. See @ref building-plugins-manual if you
want to have more control. Cross-compiling is very similar to
@ref building-cross "cross-compiling of Magnum itself".

-   @ref building-plugins-packages-vcpkg
-   @ref building-plugins-packages-arch
-   @ref building-plugins-packages-msys
-   @ref building-plugins-packages-deb
-   @ref building-plugins-packages-gentoo
-   @ref building-plugins-packages-brew

@subsection building-plugins-packages-vcpkg Vcpkg package

Magnum Plugins are available as a [Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)
package. See @ref building-packages-vcpkg "the Magnum Vcpkg documentation" for
a more detailed introduction and a troubleshooting guide. Installing latest
stable version of Magnum Plugins with all its dependencies is done like this:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install magnum-plugins
@endcode

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@par Installing latest master
    The `master` is considered stable for production use and often you may want
    to prefer it over a potentially outdated tagged release. To do so, use
    the `--head` option on `magnum-plugins` as well as its dependencies:
@par
    @code{.bat}
    vcpkg install --head corrade magnum magnum-plugins
    @endcode
@par
    Note that `vcpkg upgrade` doesn't work well with `--head` packages (it will
    go back to latest tagged version instead of updated master), you have to
    remove `magnum-plugins` as well as their dependencies and install `--head`
    again:
@par
    @code{.bat}
    vcpkg remove magnum-plugins --recurse
    vcpkg install --head corrade magnum magnum-plugins
    @endcode

Note that just a subset of plugins is installed by default. To opt-in or
opt-out of additional features, you can use the following syntax; feature names
are simply names of CMake `MAGNUM_WITH_*` options from the
@ref building-plugins-features section but lowercase, e.g.:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install magnum-plugins[assimpimporter,ddsimporter]
@endcode

To install all features of a package, use `*`, e.g.:

@code{.bat}
vcpkg install magnum-plugins[*]
@endcode

There are also Vcpkg packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-vcpkg "Magnum Integration" and
@ref building-extras-packages-vcpkg "Magnum Extras".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-arch ArchLinux packages

Package for the latest stable release is maintained in the `community` repo.
Installing is as simple as this:

@code{.sh}
sudo pacman -S magnum-plugins
@endcode

In `package/archlinux/magnum-plugins-git` there is a package for Git
development build. The package is also in AUR as
[magnum-plugins-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/magnum-plugins-git/).
It depends on @ref building-corrade-packages-arch "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-arch "Magnum" ArchLinux packages.

There are also a few development packages for native builds, cross-compilation
for Emscripten, Android and MinGW or various sanitizer/coverage builds. See the
PKGBUILD files in the `package/archlinux` directory. They allow you to build
and install the package directly from source tree. Example usage:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins && cd magnum-plugins
cd package/archlinux
makepkg -fp PKGBUILD # or any other PKGBUILD file
@endcode

@note The PKGBUILDs reference a few external dependencies such as
    `basis-universal-src` or (in case of Emscripten) `emscripten-zstd` and
    `emscripten-faad2`, which are not in AUR. You can find PKGBUILDs for these
    at https://github.com/mosra/archlinux. You can also edit the package,
    disable building of affected features and remove the dependency.

In most cases the development PKGBUILDs also contain a @cb{.sh} check() @ce
function which will run all unit tests before packaging. That might sometimes
fail or take too long, pass `--nocheck` to `makepkg` to skip that.

Once built, install the package using `pacman`:

@code{.sh}
sudo pacman -U magnum-plugins-*.pkg.tar.zst
@endcode

Edit the PKGBUILDs if you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-plugins-features "enable / disable additional features".

There are also ArchLinux packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-arch "Magnum Integration",
@ref building-extras-packages-arch "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-arch "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-msys MSYS2 packages

[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) package for the latest stable release is
mantained in the official repos. Installing is as simple as this:

@code{.sh}
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-magnum-plugins # or mingw-w64-i686-magnum-plugins
@endcode

Similarly to ArchLinux, there is one package in the
`package/msys/magnum-plugins` directory, which will download and package latest
stable release; and then a development `PKGBUILD` in `package/msys`, allowing
you to package and install the currently checked out source tree. Both depend
on corresponding @ref building-corrade-packages-msys "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-msys "Magnum" MSYS2 packages. Example usage:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins && cd magnum-plugins
cd package/msys
makepkg -fp PKGBUILD
@endcode

The above works in a 32/64bit MinGW shell, from a MSYS shell the equivalent
command is

@code{.sh}
makepkg-mingw -fp PKGBUILD
@endcode

@m_class{m-noindent}

which will build both a 32bit and a 64bit version. See the
[MSYS2 Wiki](https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/Creating-Packages) for more
information.

There are also MSYS2 packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-msys "Magnum Integration".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-deb Packages for Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives

The `package/debian/` directory contains all files needed for building Debian
packages. You need the @ref building-corrade-packages-deb "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-deb "Magnum" Debian packages installed and in addition
also the `dpkg-dev` and `debhelper` packages. Building is easy, just change
directory to package root, link or copy the `package/debian` directory there
and run `dpkg-buildpackage`:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins && cd magnum-plugins
ln -s package/debian .
dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign
@endcode

This will compile binary and development packages, which will then appear in a
parent directory. Install them using `dpkg`:

@code{.sh}
sudo dpkg -i ../magnum-plugins*.deb
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-plugins-features "enable / disable additional features", add them
to `dh_auto_configure` at the bottom of `package/debian/rules`. Watch out, as
indentation has to be done using tabs, not spaces.

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par Enabling Basis Universal and MeshOptimizer plugins
@parblock
Neither Basis Universal nor MeshOptimizer provide any packages for Debian and
thus the Magnum Plugins package doesn't have it enabled by default. In order to
enable them, do the following:

-   For @ref Trade::BasisImporter "BasisImporter" or
    @ref Trade::BasisImageConverter "BasisImageConverter", download the
    [`v1_50_0_2`](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/archive/v1_50_0_2.tar.gz)
    `1.16.4` or `v1_15_update2` tag of the Basis Universal repo, extract it
    into `src/external/basis-universal` (note the dash instead of an
    underscore) set `MAGNUM_WITH_BASISIMPORTER` /
    `MAGNUM_WITH_BASISIMAGECONVERTER` to `ON` in `package/debian/rules`
-   For @ref Trade::MeshOptimizerSceneConverter "MeshOptimizerSceneConverter",
    [clone the MeshOptimizer repo](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) to
    `src/external/meshoptimizer` and set `MAGNUM_WITH_MESHOPTIMIZERSCENECONVERTER`
    to `ON` in `package/debian/rules`.

With the above, when you run `dpkg-buildpackage`, CMake will automatically
discover the sources and link them as static libraries to corresponding
plugins.
@endparblock

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@par Enabling Glslang and SPIRV-Tools plugins
@parblock
Glslang and SPIRV-Tools packages are available only since Ubuntu 20.04 and thus
are not enabled in the Magnum Plugins package by default. In order to enable
them, do the following:

-   For @ref ShaderTools::GlslangConverter "GlslangShaderConverter", add
    `glslang-dev` to the `Build-Depends:` line in `package/debian/control` and
    set `MAGNUM_WITH_GLSLANGSHADERCONVERTER` to `ON` in `package/debian/rules`.
-   For @ref ShaderTools::SpirvToolsConverter "SpirvToolsShaderConverter",
    add `spirv-tools` to the `Build-Depends:` line in `package/debian/control`
    and set `MAGNUM_WITH_SPIRVTOOLSSHADERCONVERTER` to `ON` in
    `package/debian/rules`.

With the above, when you run `dpkg-buildpackage`, it should correctly find the
dependencies (or ask for them to be installed) and build the corresponding
plugins. The workflow is equivalent for vanilla Debian, as the packages are
named the same.
@endparblock

There are also Debian packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-deb "Magnum Integration",
@ref building-extras-packages-deb "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-deb "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-gentoo Gentoo Linux ebuilds

Gentoo Git ebuild is available in the `package/gentoo` directory. Get the
@ref building-corrade-packages-gentoo "Corrade" and
@ref building-packages-gentoo "Magnum" Gentoo packages first and then build and
install Magnum Plugins like this:

@code{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins && cd magnum-plugins
cd package/gentoo
sudo ebuild dev-libs/magnum-plugins/magnum-plugins-9999.ebuild manifest clean merge
@endcode

If you want to pass additional flags to CMake or
@ref building-plugins-features "enable / disable additional features", add them
to `mycmakeargs` in the `*.ebuild` file.

There are also Gentoo packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-gentoo "Magnum Integration",
@ref building-extras-packages-gentoo "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-gentoo "Magnum Examples".

@subsection building-plugins-packages-brew Homebrew formulas for macOS

macOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas building the latest Git revision are
in the `package/homebrew` directory. Either use the `*.rb` files directly or
use the tap at https://github.com/mosra/homebrew-magnum. This will install the
latest stable version of Magnum Plugins with all dependencies:

@code{.sh}
brew install mosra/magnum/magnum-plugins
@endcode

But often you may want to install the latest Git revision of all Magnum
projects instead:

@code{.sh}
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/corrade
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum
brew install --HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-plugins

# If already installed, use the following to upgrade, in the same order
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/corrade
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD mosra/magnum/magnum-plugins
@endcode

When installing from the `*.rb` files you need to install the
@ref building-corrade-packages-brew "Corrade"
and @ref building-packages-brew "Magnum" Homebrew packages first. As the
plugins depend on a variety of 3rd party libraries, it's possible to control a
subset that gets built and installed:

-   `--with-devil`, `--with-faad2` and `--with-harfbuzz` enable building of
    @relativeref{Trade,DevIlImageImporter},
    @ref Audio::Faad2Importer "Faad2AudioImporter" and
    @relativeref{Text,HarfBuzzFont}, respectively. None of these plugins are
    built by default.
-   `--without-assimp`, `--without-freetype`, `--without-glslang`,
    `--without-libpng`, `--without-libspng`, `--without-jpeg`,
    `--without-openexr`, `--without-spirv-tools`, `--without-zstd` and
    `--without-webp` disable building of @relativeref{Trade,AssimpImporter},
    @relativeref{Text,FreeTypeFont},
    @ref ShaderTools::GlslangConverter "GlslangShaderConverter",
    @relativeref{Trade,PngImporter} and @relativeref{Trade,PngImageConverter},
    @relativeref{Trade,JpegImporter} and
    @relativeref{Trade,JpegImageConverter}, @relativeref{Trade,OpenExrImporter}
    and @relativeref{Trade,OpenExrImageConverter},
    @ref ShaderTools::SpirvToolsConverter "SpirvToolsShaderConverter", zstd
    support in @relativeref{Trade,BasisImporter} and
    @relativeref{Trade,BasisImageConverter}, and
    @relativeref{Trade,WebPImporter}, respectively. These plugins are all
    implicitly built otherwise.

Plugins not listed above are built always. If you want to pass additional flags
to CMake or @ref building-plugins-features "enable / disable other features",
edit the `*.rb` file.

There are also Homebrew packages for
@ref building-integration-packages-brew "Magnum Integration",
@ref building-extras-packages-brew "Magnum Extras" and
@ref building-examples-packages-brew "Magnum Examples".

@section building-plugins-manual Manual build

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins.
Building the plugins is very similar to building Magnum itself. See
@ref building for additonal information about building and running tests,
cross-compiling and platform-specific issues.

Some plugins expose their internal state through separate libraries and you can
control their build separately:

-   `MAGNUM_WITH_OPENDDL` --- Build the @ref OpenDdl library. Enabled
    automatically if `MAGNUM_WITH_OPENGEXIMPORTER` is enabled.

Options controlling the build are a subset of
@ref building-features "the options used by Magnum":

-   `MAGNUM_BUILD_STATIC` --- Build all libraries as static. Default is shared,
    except on platforms such as @ref CORRADE_TARGET_ANDROID "Android" or
    @ref CORRADE_TARGET_EMSCRIPTEN "Emscripten" that don't support dynamic
    linking.
-   `MAGNUM_BUILD_STATIC_PIC` --- Build static libraries with
    position-independent code. Enabled by default when building static
    libraries, disable if you don't need this feature. On
    @ref CORRADE_TARGET_EMSCRIPTEN "Emscripten" this option is always off.
-   `MAGNUM_BUILD_PLUGINS_STATIC` --- Build plugins as static. By default,
    plugins are built as dynamic. Independent of the `MAGNUM_BUILD_STATIC`
    option to allow having static libraries with dynamic plugins and vice
    versa. To some extent it's also possible to have only a subset of plugins
    built as static --- set `MAGNUM_<PLUGIN>_BUILD_STATIC` for particular
    plugins to `ON` or `OFF` to override this option.
-   Additional options are inherited from the
    @ref CORRADE_BUILD_MULTITHREADED and
    @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_STATIC_UNIQUE_GLOBALS options specified when building
    Magnu,

Note that each plugin class / library namespace documentation contains more
detailed information about its dependencies, availability on particular
platforms and also a guide how to enable given plugin for building and how to
use it with CMake.

Libraries and static plugins built in the `Debug` configuration (e.g. with
`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` set to `Debug`) have a `-d` suffix, *dynamic* plugins in
`Debug` configuration are installed to the `magnum-d` subdirectory, similarly
to what is done when @ref building "building Magnum itself".

@section building-plugins-doc Building documentation

The documentation for plugins is built as part of of the main Magnum
documentation. Clone the projects next to each other and continue as described
in @ref building-doc.
