@brief Guide how to find and use static Magnum plugins with CMake build system

If you are going to use dynamic plugins (the default) via plugin manager, they
don't need to be handled via CMake. The manager will look for them at runtime
at specified location and loads them dynamically. However, if they are built as
static (see @ref building-plugins for more information), they need to be linked
into the executable and then explicitly imported. Also if you are going to use
them as dependencies, you need to find the dependency and then link to it.

The logic is in module `FindMagnumPlugins.cmake` distributed in plugin
repository in `modules/` directory, you are encouraged to copy it into your
project and add path to the files to `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`. Otherwise, if CMake
won't be able to find this file in predefined locations, it will error out even
if Magnum plugins might be installed on the system. Note that the module file
is updated as the library evolves, you are encouraged to update your copy from
time to time to avoid strange building issues.

If you installed the library or its dependencies to non-standard location
(other than `/usr`, e.g. `/home/xyz/projects`), set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to that
directory to help CMake find it. You can enter more different dirs if you
separate them with semicolons.

Basic usage is:

    find_package(MagnumPlugins [REQUIRED])

This command tries to find Magnum plugins and then defines:

-   `MAGNUMPLUGINS_FOUND` -- Whether Magnum plugins were found
-   `MAGNUMPLUGINS_INCLUDE_DIRS` -- Plugin include dir and include dirs of
    dependencies

This command will not try to find any actual plugin. The plugins are:

-   `AnyAudioImporter` -- @ref Audio::AnyImporter "AnyAudioImporter" plugin
-   `AnyImageConverter` -- @ref Trade::AnyImageConverter "AnyImageConverter"
    plugin
-   `AnyImageImporter` -- @ref Trade::AnyImageImporter "AnyImageImporter"
    plugin
-   `AnySceneImporter` -- @ref Trade::AnySceneImporter "AnySceneImporter"
    plugin
-   `ColladaImporter` -- @ref Trade::ColladaImporter "ColladaImporter" plugin
-   `DdsImporter` -- @ref Trade::DdsImporter "DdsImporter" plugin
-   `FreeTypeFont` -- @ref Text::FreeTypeFont "FreeTypeFont" plugin
-   `HarfBuzzFont` -- @ref Text::HarfBuzzFont "HarfBuzzFont" plugin
-   `JpegImporter` -- @ref Trade::JpegImporter "JpegImporter" plugin
-   `OpenGexImporter` -- @ref Trade::OpenGexImporter "OpenGexImporter" plugin
-   `PngImporter` -- @ref Trade::PngImporter "PngImporter" plugin
-   `StanfordImporter` -- @ref Trade::StanfordImporter "StanfordImporter"
    plugin
-   `StbImageImporter` -- @ref Trade::StbImageImporter "StbImageImporter"
    plugin
-   `StbPngImageConverter` -- @ref Trade::StbPngImageConverter "StbPngImageConverter"
    plugin
-   `StbVorbisAudioImporter` -- @ref Audio::StbVorbisImporter "StbVorbisAudioImporter" plugin

Note that each plugin class contains more detailed information about
dependencies, availability on particular platform and also guide how to enable
given library in build and use it with CMake.

Example usage with specifying the plugins is:

    find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED FreeTypeFont PngImporter)

For each plugin is then defined:

-   `MAGNUMPLUGINS_*_FOUND` -- Whether the plugin was found
-   `MAGNUMPLUGINS_*_LIBRARIES` -- Plugin library and dependent libraries
-   `MAGNUMPLUGINS_*_INCLUDE_DIRS` -- Include dirs of plugin dependencies

The package is found if either debug or release version of each requested
plugin is found. If both debug and release plugins are found, proper version is
chosen based on actual build configuration of the project (i.e. `Debug` build
is linked to debug plugins, `Release` build to release plugins). See @ref cmake
for more information about autodetection of `MAGNUM_PLUGINS_DIR`.

If @ref MAGNUM_BUILD_DEPRECATED is defined, `MAGNUMPLUGINS_INCLUDE_DIRS`
contains include dir for plugins (i.e. for includes without `MagnumPlugins/`
prefix) and include dirs of dependencies.

See also @ref cmake "Magnum usage with CMake" for more information.
