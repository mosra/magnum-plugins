@brief JPEG importer plugin

Supports RGB or grayscale images with 8 bits per channel. The images are
imported with @ref PixelFormat::RGB8Unorm or @ref PixelFormat::R8Unorm. All
imported images use default @ref PixelStorage parameters. You can use
@ref JpegImageConverter to encode images into this format.

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the [libJPEG](http://ijg.org/) library,
    released under a custom @m_class{m-label m-success} **Libjpeg license**
    ([license text](https://jpegclub.org/reference/libjpeg-license/)). It
    requires attribution for public use. Note that this plugin can be built
    against any other compatible and possibly differently-licensed libJPEG
    implementation as well.

@section Trade-JpegImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade and [libJPEG](http://libjpeg.sourceforge.net/) libraries and is built if `WITH_JPEGIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum
Plugins. To use as a dynamic plugin, load @cpp "JpegImporter" @ce
via @ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following. Using libJPEG itself as a CMake subproject isn't tested at the
moment, so you need to provide it as a system dependency and point
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to its installation dir if necessary.

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_JPEGIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::JpegImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `JpegImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package and link to the `MagnumPlugins::JpegImporter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED JpegImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::JpegImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-JpegImporter-implementations libJPEG implementations

While some systems (such as macOS) still ship only with the vanilla libJPEG,
you can get a much better decoding performance by using
[libjpeg-turbo](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/).
