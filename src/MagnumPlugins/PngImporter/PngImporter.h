@brief PNG importer plugin

Supports Portable Network Graphics (`*.png`) grayscale, grayscale+alpha, RGB or
RGBA images with 8 and 16 bits per channel. Palleted images and images with
transparency mask are automatically converted to G(A) / RGB(A). You can use
@ref PngImageConverter to encode images into this format.

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the
    [libPNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) library, released under
    the @m_class{m-label m-success} **libPNG** license
    ([license text](http://libpng.org/pub/png/src/libpng-LICENSE.txt)). It
    requires attribution for public use.

@section Trade-PngImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade and [libPNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
libraries and is built if `WITH_PNGIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum
Plugins. To use as a dynamic plugin, load @cpp "PngImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following. Using libPNG itself as a CMake subproject isn't tested at the
moment, so you need to provide it as a system dependency and point
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to its installation dir if necessary.

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_PNGIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::PngImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `PngImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package and link to the `MagnumPlugins::PngImporter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED PngImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::PngImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-PngImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

Grayscale images are imported as @ref PixelFormat::R8Unorm /
@ref PixelFormat::R16Unorm, grayscale + alpha as @ref PixelFormat::RG8Unorm /
@ref PixelFormat::RG16Unorm, RGB as @ref PixelFormat::RGB8Unorm /
@ref PixelFormat::RGB16Unorm and RGBA as @ref PixelFormat::RGBA8Unorm /
@ref PixelFormat::RGBA16Unorm. All imported images use default
@ref PixelStorage parameters.

@subsection Trade-PngImporter-behavior-cgbi Apple CgBI PNGs

CgBI is a proprietary Apple-specific extension to PNG
([details here](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/CgBI_file_format)). Stock
`libPNG` doesn't support these, you might want to use some fork that supports
it, for example https://github.com/jongwook/libpng. Or use @ref StbImageImporter,
which has the support.

The test for this plugin contains a file that can be used for verifying CgBI
support.
