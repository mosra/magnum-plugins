Creating input WebP files
========================

WebP images without alpha channel (`rgb-*.webp`) have been created on Linux OS using GIMP (GNU Image
Manipulation Program). With GIMP one can create lossless or lossy images with a range of 0-100% image quality,
with or without transparency (alpha channel), although WebP compression algorithm might not be fruitful
when used on very small data because some of the lossy images (eg.`rgb-lossy-0.webp`-`748 bytes`)
in the test folder are bigger in file size than their less compressed (eg.`rgb-lossy-45.webp`-`72 bytes`)
or even lossless equivalents (eg.`rgb-lossless.webp`-`54 bytes`).
Here is a supporting explanation on this matter:

WebP images with alpha channel (`rgba-*.webp`) have been generated by compressing png images created with GIMP
into WebP files. The conversion has been done on Linux using `cwebp` [WebP encoder](
https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp).

According to the WebP specification, WebP stores pixels exclusively in ARGB
and Y'CbCr - aka [YUV 4:2:0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6386#section-2) - format
in [lossless](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webp_lossless_bitstream_specification)
and [lossy](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq#what_color_spaces_does_the_webp_format_support)
bitstream respectively. However, WebP gives a lot of flexibility to the user in terms of compression factor
and colorspace choice both in encoding and decoding, which enables optional creation of/conversion to WebP
images in various formats and image qualities with or without transparency.

Other images have been taken from WebP [image gallery](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/gallery).
