@brief WebP importer plugin


@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the
    [libwebp](https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp/) library, released under the same license as the
    @m_class{m-label m-success} **WebM** project
    ([license text](https://www.webmproject.org/license/software/ )). It
    requires attribution for public use.

@section Trade-WebPImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade and [libwebp](https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp/)
libraries and is built if `WITH_WEBPIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum
Plugins. To use as a dynamic plugin, load @cpp "WebPImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following. Using libwebp itself as a CMake subproject isn't tested at the
moment, so you need to provide it as a system dependency and point
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to its installation dir if necessary.

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_WEBPIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::WebPImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `WebPImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package and link to the `MagnumPlugins::WebPImporter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED WebPImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::WebPImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-WebPImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

WebP supports 24-bit RGB color (8-bit color-depth for each channel) with an 8-bit alpha channel in case of transparency.
It doesn't have a special colorspace for grayscale or black-and-white. A grayscale/bw image buffer is simply supposed
to be converted to a RGB buffer to encode it in WebP format.

WebPImporter has been created using the decoder included in the WebP library.
Hence, it doesn't support decoding of animated WebP files, for which 'Demux' library of the WebP is needed.

@ref PixelFormat::RGB8Unorm for (lossy or lossless) bitstream with no transparency (alpha channel) /
@ref PixelFormat::RGBA8Unorm for any bitstream with transparency.
