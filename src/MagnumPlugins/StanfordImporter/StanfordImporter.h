@brief Stanford PLY importer plugin

@m_keywords{PLY}

Supports Little- and Big-Endian binary formats with triangle and quad meshes.
Imports vertex positions, normals, 2D texture coordinates, vertex colors,
custom attributes and per-face data as well.

@section Trade-StanfordImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`WITH_STANFORDIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum Plugins. To use as a
dynamic plugin, load @cpp "StanfordImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_STANFORDIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::StanfordImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `StanfordImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package and link to the `MagnumPlugins::StanfordImporter`
target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED StanfordImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::StanfordImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-StanfordImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

In order to optimize for fast import, the importer supports a restricted subset
of PLY features, which however shouldn't affect any real-world models.

-   Both Little- and Big-Endian binary files are supported, with bytes swapped
    to match platform endianness. ASCII files are not supported due to the
    storage size overhead and inherent inefficiency of float literal parsing.
-   Position coordinates (`x`/`y`/`z`) are expected to have the same type, be
    tightly packed in a XYZ order and be either 32-bit floats or (signed) bytes
    or shorts. Resulting position type is then
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3, @ref VertexFormat::Vector3ub,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3b, @ref VertexFormat::Vector3us or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3s. 32-bit integer and double positions are not
    supported.
-   Normal coordinates (`nx`/`ny`/`nz`) are expected to have the same type, be
    tightly packed in a XYZ order and be either 32-bit floats or *signed* bytes
    or shorts. Resulting normal type is then
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3, @ref VertexFormat::Vector3bNormalized or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3sNormalized. 32-bit integer, unsigned and double
    normals are not supported.
-   Texture coordinates (`u`/`v` or `s`/`t`) are expected to have the same
    type, be tightly packed in a XY order and be either 32-bit floats or
    * *unsigned* bytes or shorts. Resulting texture coordinate type is then
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector2, @ref VertexFormat::Vector2ubNormalized or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector2usNormalized. Double texture coordinates are not
    supported, signed and 32.bit integer coordinates don't have a well-defined
    mapping to the @f$ [0, 1] @f$ range and thus are not supported either.
-   Color channels (`red`/`green`/`blue` and optional `alpha`) are expected
    to have the same type, be tightly packed in a RGB or RGBA order and be
    either 32-bit floats or unsigned bytes/shorts. Tesulting color type is then
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3 / @ref VertexFormat::Vector4,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3ubNormalized / @ref VertexFormat::Vector4ubNormalized
    or @ref VertexFormat::Vector3usNormalized /
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector4usNormalized. Signed, 32-bit integer and double
    colors are not supported.
-   Per-vertex object ID attribute is imported as either
    @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedInt, @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedShort or
    @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedByte. By default `object_id` is the recognized
    name, use the @cb{.ini} objectIdAttribute @ce
    @ref Trade-StanfordImporter-configuration "configuration option" to change
    the identifier that's being looked for. Because there are real-world files
    with signed object IDs, signed types are allowed as well, but interpreted
    as unsigned.
-   Indices (`vertex_indices` or `vertex_index`) are imported as either
    @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedByte, @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedShort or
    @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedInt. Quads are triangulated, but higher-order
    polygons are not supported. Because there are real-world files with signed
    indices, signed types are allowed for indices as well, but interpreted as
    unsigned (because negative values wouldn't make sense anyway).

The mesh is always indexed; positions are always present, other attributes are
optional.

The importer recognizes @ref ImporterFlag::Verbose, printing additional info
when the flag is enabled.

@subsection Trade-StanfordImporter-behavior-per-face Per-face attributes

By default, if the mesh contains per-face attributes apart from indices, these
get converted to per-vertex during import. This is what the users usually want,
however for large meshes this may have a performance impact due to calculating
only unique per-vertex/per-face data combinations. If this conversion takes
place, the resulting index type is always @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedInt,
independent of what the file has.

Alternatively, if the @cb{.ini} perFaceToPerVertex @ce
@ref Trade-StanfordImporter-configuration "configuration option" is disabled,
the importer provides access to per-face attributes in a second mesh level ---
i.e., @ref meshLevelCount() returns @cpp 2 @ce in that case, and calling
@ref mesh() with @p level set to @cpp 1 @ce will return a @ref MeshData
instance with @ref MeshPrimitive::Faces. The faces are triangulated, which
means each item contains data for three vertices in the
@ref MeshPrimitive::Triangles mesh at <tt>level</tt> @cpp 0 @ce.

From the builtin attributes, colors, normals and object IDs can be either
per-vertex or per-face, positions and texture coordinates are always
per-vertex.

@subsection Trade-StanfordImporter-behavior-custom-attributes Custom attributes

Custom and unrecognized vertex and face attributes of known types are present
in the imported meshes as well. Their mapping to/from a string can be queried
using @ref meshAttributeName() and @ref meshAttributeForName(). Attributes with
unknown types cause the import to fail, as the format relies on knowing the
type size.

@section Trade-StanfordImporter-configuration Plugin-specific config

It's possible to tune various import options through @ref configuration(). See
below for all options and their default values:

@snippet MagnumPlugins/StanfordImporter/StanfordImporter.conf config

See @ref plugins-configuration for more information and an example showing how
to edit the configuration values.
