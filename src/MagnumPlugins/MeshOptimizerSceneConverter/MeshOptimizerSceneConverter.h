@brief MeshOptimizer converter plugin
@m_since_{plugins,2020,06}

Integrates various algorithms from [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer).

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the
    [meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) library by Arseny
    Kapoulkine, released under @m_class{m-label m-success} **MIT**
    ([license text](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/blob/master/LICENSE.md),
    [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)).

@section Trade-MeshOptimizerSceneConverter-usage Usage

@m_class{m-note m-success}

@par
    This class is a plugin that's meant to be dynamically loaded and used
    through the base @ref AbstractSceneConverter interface. See its
    documentation for introduction and usage examples.

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`MAGNUM_WITH_MESHOPTIMIZERSCENECONVERTER` is enabled when building Magnum
Plugins. To use as a dynamic plugin, load @cpp "MeshOptimizerSceneConverter" @ce
via @ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and
[meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) repositories and do the
following. If you want to use system-installed meshoptimizer, omit the first
part and point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to its installation dir if necessary.

@code{.cmake}
set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) # needed if building dynamic plugins
add_subdirectory(meshoptimizer EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

set(MAGNUM_WITH_MESHOPTIMIZERSCENECONVERTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::MeshOptimizerSceneConverter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `MeshOptimizerSceneConverter` component of
the `MagnumPlugins` package and link to the
`MagnumPlugins::MeshOptimizerSceneConverter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED MeshOptimizerSceneConverter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::MeshOptimizerSceneConverter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins and @ref plugins for more
information.

@section Trade-MeshOptimizerSceneConverter-behavior Behavior and limitations

The plugin by default performs the following optimizations, which can be
@ref Trade-MeshOptimizerSceneConverter-configuration "configured further" using
plugin-specific options:

-   [Vertex cache optimization](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer#vertex-cache-optimization),
    performed when @cb{.ini} optimizeVertexCache @ce is enabled
-   [Overdraw optimization](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer#overdraw-optimization),
    performed when @cb{.ini} optimizeOverdraw @ce is enabled
-   [Vertex fetch optimization](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer#vertex-fetch-optimization),
    performed when @cb{.ini} optimizeVertexFetch @ce is enabled

The optimizations can be done either in-place using @ref convertInPlace(MeshData&),
in which case the input is required to be an indexed triangle mesh with mutable
contiguous index buffer of a non-implementation-specific index type and, in
case of @cb{.ini} optimizeVertexFetch @ce, also mutable vertex data.
Alternatively, the operation can be performed using @ref convert(const MeshData&),
which accepts also triangle strips and fans or non-contiguous index buffers of
non-implementation-specific index types, returning always an indexed triangle
mesh without requiring the input to be mutable.

The output has the same index type as input and all attributes are preserved,
including custom attributes and attributes with implementation-specific vertex
formats, except for @cb{.ini} optimizeOverdraw @ce, which needs a position
attribute in a known type. Attributes with zero or negative stride are allowed
on input but the output will always have an interleaved layout with positive
strides.

When @ref SceneConverterFlag::Verbose is enabled, the plugin prints the output
from meshoptimizer's [efficiency analyzers](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer#efficiency-analyzers)
before and after the operation. @ref SceneConverterFlag::Quiet is recognized as
well and causes all conversion warnings to be suppressed.

@subsection Trade-MeshOptimizerSceneConverter-behavior-simplification Mesh simplification

By default the plugin performs only the above non-destructive operations.
[Mesh simplification](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer#simplification) can
be enabled using either the @cb{.ini} simplify @ce or @cb{.ini} simplifySloppy @ce
@ref Trade-MeshOptimizerSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" together with specifying desired @cb{.ini} simplifyTargetIndexCountThreshold @ce
--- the default value of 1.0 will leave the mesh unchanged, set it to for
example 0.25 to reduce the mesh to a fourth of its size.

The simplification process is done in @ref convert(const MeshData&) and returns
a copy of the mesh with a subset of original vertices and a reduced index
buffer, meaning the original vertex positions are used, with no interpolation
to new locations. It only requires the mesh to have a position attribute, mesh
connectivity and face seams are figured out from the index buffer. As with all
other operations, all original attributes are preserved.

The simplification can result in the whole mesh being removed if either the
@cb{.ini} simplifyTargetError @ce is set too high or the input consists of just
degenerate triangles. By default a mesh with zero vertices is returned in that
case, enable the @cb{.ini} simplifyFailEmpty @ce option to make the process
fail in that case instead. There are also other
@ref Trade-MeshOptimizerSceneConverter-configuration "simplification options".

@section Trade-MeshOptimizerSceneConverter-configuration Plugin-specific configuration

It's possible to tune various output options through @ref configuration(). See
below for all options and their default values:

@snippet MagnumPlugins/MeshOptimizerSceneConverter/MeshOptimizerSceneConverter.conf configuration_

See @ref plugins-configuration for more information and an example showing how
to edit the configuration values.
