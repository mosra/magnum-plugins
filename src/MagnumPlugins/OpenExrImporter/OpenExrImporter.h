@brief OpenEXR importer plugin
@m_since_latest_{plugins}

Supports single-part scanline and tile-based OpenEXR (`*.exr`) 2D and cubemap
images with optional mip levels and half-float, float and unsigned integer
channels. You can use @ref OpenExrImageConverter to encode images into this
format.

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the [OpenEXR](https://www.openexr.com)
    library, licensed under @m_class{m-label m-success} **BSD 3-clause**
    ([license text](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/blob/master/LICENSE.md),
    [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/)).
    It requires attribution for public use.

@section Trade-OpenExrImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`WITH_OPENEXRIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum Plugins. To use as a
dynamic plugin, load @cpp "OpenExrImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and
[openexr](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr) repositories
(pin OpenEXR at `v3.0.1` at least) and do the following. OpenEXR depends on
zlib and Imath, however it's capable of fetching those dependencies on its own
so bundling them isn't necessary. If you want to use system-installed OpenEXR,
omit the  first part and point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to its installation dir if
necessary.

@code{.cmake}
# Disable unneeded functionality
set(PYILMBASE_ENABLE OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(IMATH_INSTALL_PKG_CONFIG OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(IMATH_INSTALL_SYM_LINK OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(OPENEXR_INSTALL OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(OPENEXR_INSTALL_DOCS OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(OPENEXR_INSTALL_EXAMPLES OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(OPENEXR_INSTALL_PKG_CONFIG OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(OPENEXR_INSTALL_TOOLS OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
set(OPENEXR_BUILD_UTILS OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
# Otherwise OpenEXR uses C++14, and before OpenEXR 3.0.2 also forces C++14 on
# all libraries that link to it.
set(OPENEXR_CXX_STANDARD 11 CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
# OpenEXR implicitly bundles Imath. However, without this only the first CMake
# run will pass and subsequent runs will fail.
set(CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Imath ON)
# These variables may be used by other projects, so ensure they're reset back
# to their original values after. OpenEXR forces CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX to _d,
# which isn't desired outside of that library.
set(_PREV_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ${BUILD_SHARED_LIBS})
set(_PREV_BUILD_TESTING ${BUILD_TESTING})
set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF)
set(BUILD_TESTING OFF)
set(CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX "" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(openexr EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ${_PREV_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS})
set(BUILD_TESTING ${_PREV_BUILD_TESTING})
unset(CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX CACHE)

set(WITH_OPENEXRIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::OpenExrImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
and [FindOpenEXR.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindOpenEXR.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `OpenExrImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package in CMake and link to the
`MagnumPlugins::OpenExrImporter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED OpenExrImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::OpenExrImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-OpenExrImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

@subsection Trade-OpenExrImporter-behavior-channel-mapping Channel mapping

Images containing `R`, `G`, `B` or `A` channels are imported as
@ref PixelFormat::R16F / @relativeref{PixelFormat,RG16F} /
@relativeref{PixelFormat,RGB16F} / @relativeref{PixelFormat,RGBA16F},
@ref PixelFormat::R32F / @relativeref{PixelFormat,RG32F} /
@relativeref{PixelFormat,RGB32F} / @relativeref{PixelFormat,RGBA32F} or
@ref PixelFormat::R32UI / @relativeref{PixelFormat,RG32UI} /
@relativeref{PixelFormat,RGB32UI} / @relativeref{PixelFormat,RGBA32UI}, all
channels are expected to have the same type.

If neither of the color channels is present and a a `Z` channel is present
instead, the image is imported as @ref PixelFormat::Depth32F, expecting the
channel to be of a float type.

If a file doesn't match ither of the above, custom channel mapping can be
supplied @ref Trade-OpenExrImporter-configuration "in the configuration".

@subsection Trade-OpenExrImporter-behavior-data-layout Data alignment, display and data windows

Image rows are always aligned to four bytes.

OpenEXR image metadata contain a display and data window, which can be used for
annotating crop borders or specifying that the data is just a small portion of
a larger image. The importer ignores the display window and imports everything
that's inside the data window, without offseting it in any way.

@subsection Trade-OpenExrImporter-behavior-multilayer-multipart Multilayer and multipart images, deep images

Images with custom layers (for example with separate channels for a left and
right view) can be imported by specifying the @cb{.ini} layer @ce
@ref Trade-OpenExrImporter-configuration "configuration option".

Multipart and deep images are not supported right now --- only the first part /
sample gets imported.

@subsection Trade-OpenExrImporter-behavior-multilevel Multilevel images

Tiled OpenEXR images with multiple mip levels are imported with the largest
level first, with the size divided by 2 in each following level. For
non-power-of-two sizes, the file format supports sizes rounded either up or
down.

The file format doesn't have a builtin way to describe level count for
incomplete mip chains, instead the file can have some tiles missing. This is
detected on import and empty levels at the end are not counted into the
reported level count, with a message printed if @ref ImporterFlag::Verbose is
enabled.

[Ripmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_filtering#An_improvement_on_isotropic_MIP_mapping)
files are imported as a single-level image right now.

@subsection Trade-OpenExrImporter-behavior-cubemap Cube and lat/lon environment maps

A lat/long environment map is imported as a 2D image without any indication of
its type.

OpenEXR stores cubemaps as 2D images with the height being six times of its
width. For convenience these are imported as a 3D image with each face being
one slice, in order +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z and -Z. Cube maps can have mip levels as
well, however because OpenEXR treats them internally as 2D images, it includes
also levels with @cpp height < 6 @ce. Because those would result in a 3D image
with zero height, the smallest levels are ignored, with a message printed if
@ref ImporterFlag::Verbose is enabled.

@section Trade-OpenExrImporter-configuration Plugin-specific configuration

It's possible to tune various options mainly for channel mapping through
@ref configuration(). See below for all options and their default values:

@snippet MagnumPlugins/OpenExrImporter/OpenExrImporter.conf config

See @ref plugins-configuration for more information and an example showing how
to edit the configuration values.
