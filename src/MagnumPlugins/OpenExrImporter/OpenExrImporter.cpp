       missing levels in the middle and partially missing levels as import
       error (which will fail with "Tile (a, b, c, d) is missing").

       OF COURSE nothing is ever easy and there's just a SINGLE boolean getter
       for whether the whole file is complete, with the docs suggesting that I
       catch some stupid exception DURING A READ when a tile is missing. HAHA
       FUCK, I NEED THAT SOONER THO. The info for particular tiles *is* there
       (because that's how the exception gets thrown, eh?), but hidden in a
       private struct, and even though I could use Imf::TileOffsets::readFrom()
       to reparse this information from the file header and then go somewhat
       sanely tile by tile, the corresponding include file isn't installed.

       "Fortunately" there's rawTileData(). The docs are useless and after
       wasting a ton of time deep in the sources, I realized that the only
       thing it does is sequentially reading through the file and DISCOVERING
       tiles and their coordinates as it goes:
        https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/blob/v3.0.4/src/lib/OpenEXR/ImfTiledInputFile.cpp#L470-L474
       And because the EXR file has the tile data at its very end, when this
       thing reaches the end, it'll simply cause the MemoryIStream::read() to
       throw up. Not to mention this function calls it with a NULL POINTER,
       which is very amazing, very -- or is that because the TileBuffer thing
       isn't initialized properly? Hmmm. OTOH that could mean all the data
       actually aren't copied during the process, which would make it kinda
       the same efficiency as TileOffsets::readFrom()?

    /* Let's stop here for a bit and contemplate on all the missed
       opportunities. The OpenEXR framebuffer contains mapping of particular
       channels to strided 2D memory locations, which sounds extremely great...
       in theory. In practice, UNFORTUNATELY:

        1.  Strides are a size_t, which means the library doesn't want me to
            use it to do an Y flip (or an X flip, for that matter).
        2.  The file contains an INCREASING_Y or DECREASING_Y attribute, but
            that's only used when writing the file, I suppose to allow
            streaming the data in Y up direction without having to buffer
            everything. It would be great if I could consume the file in the
            other direction as well, but the API doesn't allow me to and
            instead shuffles the data around only for me to shuffle them back.
        3.  file.readPixels() takes two parameters. That would be a THIRD
            opportunity to allow an Y-flip, BUT NO, the two parameters are
            interpreted the same way regardless of whether I do this or that:

                file.readPixels(dataWindow.max.y, dataWindow.min.y)
                file.readPixels(dataWindow.min.y, dataWindow.max.y)

       According to the PDFs, readPixels() is where multithreading happens, so
       calling it one by one with a different framebuffer setup to adjust for
       an Y flip would be a sequential misery. TL;DR: At first I was happy
       because EXR seemed like finally a format developed by the *real* VFX
       industry but nah, it's the same poorly implemented shit with pointless
       restrictions as everything else.

       Later I discovered that the library has very poor checks for out of
       bounds accesses and so it seems I can force `std::size_t(-rowStride)`
       together with a specially crafted base pointer and it'll work without
       throwing confused exceptions at us.

       But then I patted myself on the back for being such a 1337 H4X0R and
       deleted all that. For my sanity I'm doing a flip on the resulting data
       instead, which is also consistent with what needs to be done for
       cubemaps below. */

    /* Compared to the (simple) 2D case, the cube map case is a lot more
       complex -- either GL or EXR is insane and so I have to flip differently
       for each face:

        +X is X-flipped
        -X is X-flipped
        +Y is Y-flipped
        -Y is Y-flipped
        +Z is X-flipped
        -Z is X-flipped

       It could have worked by creating six different framebuffers, with each
       set up differently, however while Y flip would be possible using the
       `std::size_t(-rowStride)` hack mentioned above unfortunately I can't do
       the same for X. The scanline copying code in question
       (copyIntoFrameBuffer() in ImfMisc.cpp and the code calling it from
       ImfScanLineInputFile.cpp) is along these lines, i.e. endPtr being
       already smaller than writePtr to begin with and thus the loop never
       entered:

        char* writePtr = linePtr + dMinX*xStride;
        char* endPtr = linePtr + dmaxX*xStride;
        …
        while(writePtr <= endPtr) {
            …
            writePtr += xStride;
        }

       Which means I'd have to special-case the ±X/±Z faces and perform X flip
       manually, at which point I realized I could just throw it all away and
       do the flip in post on the imported data, thus happily sharing all code
       between the 2D and cubemap case. */
