            /* Mildly crazy code to achieve the following:
                -   Script values not supported by given HarfBuzz version
                    result in HB_SCRIPT_INVALID being used, and this function
                    returning false.
                -   Script values supported by HarfBuzz are simply passed
                    through, as the Script and hb_script_t values are matching
                    by design and thus no complicated lookup table is needed.
                -   As there's 160+ scripts, with the vast majority supported
                    by all HarfBuzz versions, going through a giant "whitelist"
                    switch every time would be unnecessary overhead. So instead
                    it's an inverse, listing only scripts that *aren't*
                    supported. Supported scripts will thus fall through all
                    cases and be passed through. It's very likely that a
                    HarfBuzz version with most scripts is used, which means the
                    switch has very few cases. This also allows to pass
                    yet-unknown Script values to HarfBuzz, for example when
                    there's a new version out and
                -   As the switch lists just a very few cases and not all, it
                    needs to have the fallthrough in a `default` case instead
                    of outside of the switch to avoid compiler warnings about
                    100+ unhandled values.
                -   In case a HarfBuzz version that supports all scripts is
                    used, there would be no `case` left for the `return false`
                    codepath. It's thus `#if`'d away if a version for which
                    everything from scriptMapping.h is supported.
                -   If `default` would be last and the `#if` would be compiled
                    away, it could lead to accidents where newly added values
                    from scriptMapping.h fall through to the default case if
                    the HB_VERSION_ATLEAST() isn't updated appropriately:

                        switch(script) {
                            case Script::SomeNewScript:
                                // return true; compiled out
                            default:
                                _script = HB_SCRIPT_INVALID;
                                return false;
                        }

                    To prevent that, the `default` case is first. Accidental
                    omission of the `return true` will then lead to a compiler
                    error, either due to a `case` having no body, or due to
                    a codepath not having a `return`. Interestingly, it *does
                    not* cause the `default` to be picked always. */
