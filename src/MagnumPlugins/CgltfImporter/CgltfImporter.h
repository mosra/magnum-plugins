@brief Cgltf importer plugin
@m_since_latest_{plugins}

@m_keywords{GltfImporter}

Imports glTF and binary glTF using the [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf)
library.

This plugin provides the `GltfImporter` plugin.

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf)
    library, licensed under @m_class{m-label m-success} **MIT**
    ([license text](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf/blob/master/LICENSE),
    [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)).
    It requires attribution for public use. Cgltf itself uses
    [jsmn](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), licensed under
    @m_class{m-label m-success} **MIT** as well
    ([license text](https://github.com/zserge/jsmn/blob/master/LICENSE)).

@section Trade-CgltfImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and the @ref AnyImageImporter
plugin and is built if `WITH_CGLTFIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum
Plugins. To use as a dynamic plugin, load @cpp "CgltfImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_ANYIMAGEIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

set(WITH_CGLTFIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::CgltfImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `CgltfImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package and link to the `MagnumPlugins::CgltfImporter`
target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED CgltfImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::CgltfImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-CgltfImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

The plugin supports @ref ImporterFeature::OpenData and
@ref ImporterFeature::FileCallback features. All buffers are loaded on-demand
and kept in memory for any later access. As a result, external file loading
callbacks are called with @ref InputFileCallbackPolicy::LoadPermanent.
Resources returned from file callbacks can only be safely freed after closing
the importer instance. In case of images, the files are loaded on-demand inside
@ref image2D() calls with @ref InputFileCallbackPolicy::LoadTemporary and
@ref InputFileCallbackPolicy::Close is emitted right after the file is fully
read.

Error reporting by cgltf is rather rudimentary, resulting in vague error
messages and no line numbers for several classes of errors, including
out-of-bounds indices and missing required attributes. If you need more
detailed errors, consider using the [glTF Validator](https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Validator/).

The content of the global [extensionsRequired](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#specifying-extensions)
array is checked against all extensions supported by the plugin. If a glTF file
requires an unknown extension, the import will fail. This behaviour can be
disabled with the @cb{.ini} ignoreRequiredExtensions @ce
@ref Trade-CgltfImporter-configuration "configuration option".

Import of morph data is not supported at the moment.

@subsection Trade-CgltfImporter-behavior-animation Animation and skin import

-   Linear quaternion rotation tracks are postprocessed in order to make it
    possible to use the faster
    @ref Math::lerp(const Quaternion<T>&, const Quaternion<T>&, T) "Math::lerp()" /
    @ref Math::slerp(const Quaternion<T>&, const Quaternion<T>&, T) "Math::slerp()"
    functions instead of
    @ref Math::lerpShortestPath(const Quaternion<T>&, const Quaternion<T>&, T) "Math::lerpShortestPath()" /
    @ref Math::slerpShortestPath(const Quaternion<T>&, const Quaternion<T>&, T) "Math::slerpShortestPath()". Can be disabled per-animation with the
    @cb{.ini} optimizeQuaternionShortestPath @ce
    @ref Trade-CgltfImporter-configuration "configuration option". This doesn't
    affect spline-interpolated rotation tracks.
-   If linear quaternion rotation tracks are not normalized, the importer
    prints a warning and normalizes them. Can be disabled per-animation with
    the @cb{.ini} normalizeQuaternions @ce
    @ref Trade-CgltfImporter-configuration "configuration option". This doesn't
    affect spline-interpolated rotation tracks.
-   Skin `skeleton` property is not imported
-   Morph targets are not supported
-   Animation tracks are always imported with
    @ref Animation::Extrapolation::Constant, because glTF doesn't support
    anything else
-   It's possible to request all animation clips to be merged into one using
    the @cb{.ini} mergeAnimationClips @ce option in order to for example
    preserve cinematic animations when using the Blender glTF exporter (as it
    otherwise outputs a separate clip for each object). When this option is
    enabled, @ref animationCount() always report either @cpp 0 @ce or
    @cpp 1 @ce and the merged animation has no name. With this option enabled,
    however, it can happen that multiple conflicting tracks affecting the same
    node are merged in the same clip, causing the animation to misbehave.

@subsection Trade-CgltfImporter-behavior-objects Scene and object import

-   If no @cb{.json} "scene" @ce property is present and the file contains at
    least one scene, @ref defaultScene() returns @cpp 0 @ce instead of
    @cpp -1 @ce. According to the [glTF 2.0 specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#scenes)
    the importer is free to not render anything, but the suggested behavior
    would break even some official sample models.
-   In case object transformation is set via separate
    translation/rotation/scaling properties in the source file,
    @ref ObjectData3D is created with @ref ObjectFlag3D::HasTranslationRotationScaling and these separate properties accessible
-   If object rotation quaternion is not normalized, the importer prints a
    warning and normalizes it. Can be disabled per-object with the
    @cb{.ini} normalizeQuaternions @ce
    @ref Trade-CgltfImporter-configuration "configuration option".

@subsection Trade-CgltfImporter-behavior-camera Camera import

-   Cameras in glTF are specified with vertical FoV and vertical:horizontal
    aspect ratio, these values are recalculated for horizontal FoV and
    horizontal:vertical aspect ratio as is common in Magnum

@subsection Trade-CgltfImporter-behavior-lights Light import

-   The importer supports the [KHR_lights_punctual](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_lights_punctual/README.md)
    extension

@subsection Trade-CgltfImporter-behavior-meshes Mesh import

-   Indices are imported as either @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedByte,
    @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedShort or @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedInt
-   Positions are imported as @ref VertexFormat::Vector3,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3ub, @ref VertexFormat::Vector3b,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3us, @ref VertexFormat::Vector3s,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3ubNormalized,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3bNormalized,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3usNormalized or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3sNormalized (which includes the additional types
    specified by [KHR_mesh_quantization](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization/README.md))
-   Normals, if any, are imported as @ref VertexFormat::Vector3,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3bNormalized or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3sNormalized
-   Texture coordinates are imported as @ref VertexFormat::Vector3,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3ub, @ref VertexFormat::Vector3b,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3us, @ref VertexFormat::Vector3s,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3ubNormalized,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3bNormalized,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3usNormalized or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3sNormalized (which includes the additional types
    specified by [KHR_mesh_quantization](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization/README.md)). The
    data are by default Y-flipped on import unless
    @cb{.conf} textureCoordinateYFlipInMaterial @ce is either explicitly
    enabled, or if the file contains non-normalized integer or normalized
    signed integer texture coordinates (which can't easily be flipped). In that
    case texture coordinate data are kept as-is and materials provide a texture
    transformation that does the Y-flip instead.
-   Colors are imported as @ref VertexFormat::Vector3,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector4,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3ubNormalized,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector4ubNormalized,
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector3usNormalized or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector4usNormalized
-   Joint IDs and weights for skinning are imported as custom vertex attributes
    named "JOINTS" and "WEIGHTS". Their mapping to/from a string can be queried
    using @ref meshAttributeName() and @ref meshAttributeForName().
    Joint IDs are imported as @ref VertexFormat::Vector4ub or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector4us. Joint weights are imported as
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector4, @ref VertexFormat::Vector4ubNormalized or
    @ref VertexFormat::Vector4usNormalized.
-   Per-vertex object ID attribute is imported as either
    @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedInt, @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedShort or
    @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedByte. By default `_OBJECT_ID` is the recognized
    name, use the @cb{.ini} objectIdAttribute @ce
    @ref Trade-CgltfImporter-configuration "configuration option" to change
    the identifier that's being looked for.
-   Multi-primitive meshes are loaded as follows, consistently with the
    behavior of @link AssimpImporter @endlink:
    -   The @ref meshCount() query returns a number of all *primitives*, not
        meshes
    -   Each multi-primitive mesh is split into a sequence of @ref MeshData
        instances following each other
    -   @ref meshForName() points to the first mesh in given sequence and
        @ref meshName() returns the same name for all meshes in given
        sequence
    -   The @ref object3DCount() query returns a number of all nodes extended
        with number of extra nodes for each additional mesh primitive
    -   Each node referencing a multi-primitive mesh is split into a sequence
        of @ref MeshObjectData3D instances following each other; the extra
        nodes being a direct and immediate children of the first one with an
        identity transformation
    -   @ref object3DForName() points to the first object containing the first
        primitive, @ref object3DName() returns the same name for all objects in
        given sequence
    -   @ref AnimationData instances returned by @ref animation() have their
        @ref AnimationData::trackTarget() values patched to account for the
        extra nodes, always pointing to the first object in the sequence and
        thus indirectly affecting transformations of the extra nodes
        represented as its children
-   Attribute-less meshes either with or without an index buffer are supported,
    however since glTF has no way of specifying vertex count for those,
    returned @ref Trade::MeshData::vertexCount() is set to @cpp 0 @ce

Custom and unrecognized vertex attributes of allowed types are present in the
imported meshes as well. Their mapping to/from a string can be queried using
@ref meshAttributeName() and @ref meshAttributeForName(). Attributes with
unsupported types (such as non-normalized integer matrices) cause the import to
fail.

@subsection Trade-CgltfImporter-behavior-materials Material import

-   If present, builtin [metallic/roughness](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#metallic-roughness-material) material is imported,
    setting @ref MaterialType::PbrMetallicRoughness on the @ref MaterialData.
-   If the [KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness/README.md)
    extension is present, its properties are imported with
    @ref MaterialType::PbrSpecularGlossiness present in material types.
-   Additional normal, occlusion and emissive maps are imported, together with
    related properties
-   If the [KHR_materials_unlit](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_unlit/README.md)
    extension is present, @ref MaterialType::Flat is set in material types,
    replacing @ref MaterialType::PbrMetallicRoughness or
    @ref MaterialType::PbrSpecularGlossiness.
-   If the [KHR_materials_clearcoat](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_clearcoat/README.md)
    extension is present, @ref MaterialType::PbrClearCoat is set in material
    types, and a new layer with clearcoat properties is added
-   Custom texture coordinate sets as well as [KHR_texture_transform](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_transform/README.md)
    properties are imported on all textures.
-   If the on-by-default @cb{.ini} phongMaterialFallback @ce
    @ref Trade-CgltfImporter-configuration "configuration option" is
    enabled, the importer provides a Phong fallback for backwards
    compatibility:
    -   @ref MaterialType::Phong is added to material types
    -   Base color and base color texture along with custom texture coordinate
        set and transformation, if present, is exposed as a diffuse color and
        texture, unless already present together with specular color / texture
        from the specular/glossiness material
    -   All other @ref PhongMaterialData values are is kept at their defaults

@subsection Trade-CgltfImporter-behavior-textures Texture and image import

<ul>
<li>Texture type is always @ref Trade::TextureType::Texture2D, as glTF doesn't
support anything else</li>
<li>Z coordinate of @ref Trade::TextureData::wrapping() is always
@ref SamplerWrapping::Repeat, as glTF doesn't support 3D textures</li>
<li>
@m_class{m-nopadb}

glTF leaves the defaults of sampler properties to the application, the
following defaults have been chosen for this importer:

-   Minification/magnification/mipmap filter: @ref SamplerFilter::Linear,
    @ref SamplerMipmap::Linear
-   Wrapping (all axes): @ref SamplerWrapping::Repeat
</li>
<li>
    The importer supports the following extensions for image types not defined
    in the [core glTF 2.0 specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#gltf-basics):
    [MSFT_texture_dds](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/MSFT_texture_dds/README.md)
    for DirectDraw Surface images (`*.dds`),
    [KHR_texture_basisu](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu/README.md)
    for Khronos Texture 2.0 images (`*.ktx2`) with [Basis Universal](https://github.com/binomialLLC/basis_universal)
    supercompression, as well as the original provisional `GOOGLE_texture_basis`
    extension for referencing plain Basis Universal files (`*.basis`). There was
    no formal specification of the extension but the use is like below,
    [equivalently to Basis own glTF example](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/blob/1cae1d57266e2c95bc011b0bf1ccb9940988c184/webgl/gltf/assets/AgiHqSmall.gltf#L230-L240):

    @code{.json}
    {
        ...
        "textures": [
            {
                "extensions": {
                    "GOOGLE_texture_basis": {
                        "source": 0
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
        "images": [
            {
                "mimeType": "image/x-basis",
                "uri": "texture.basis"
            }
        ],
        "extensionsUsed": [
            "GOOGLE_texture_basis"
        ],
        "extensionsRequired": [
            "GOOGLE_texture_basis"
        ]
    }
    @endcode

    The MIME type (if one exists) is ignored by the importer. Delegation to the
    correct importer alias happens via @ref AnyImageImporter which uses the
    file extension or buffer content to determine the image type.
</li>
</ul>
