Updating test files
===================

The `*.ktx2?` files are created using [Khronos Texture Tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software) as well as [PVRTexTool](https://developer.imaginationtech.com/pvrtextool/).

Install both of those and then execute the `generate.sh` script to create the test files.
