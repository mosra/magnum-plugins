Updating test files
===================

Most of the `*.ktx2?` files are created using [Khronos Texture Tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software) as well as [PVRTexTool](https://developer.imaginationtech.com/pvrtextool/).

Install both of those and then execute the `generate.sh` script to create the test files.

The remaining files (various .ktx2 files, .bin files for compressed block data) are generated by running both KtxImageConverterTest and KtxImporterTest (in that order!) with `--save-diagnostic [path/to/this/folder]` until they stop failing. Use a third-party viewer to make sure the .ktx2 files load correctly and look plausible.
