/**
@brief KTX2 image importer plugin
@m_since_latest_{plugins}

Supports Khronos Texture 2.0 images (`*.ktx2`). You can use
@ref KtxImageConverter to encode images into this format.

@section Trade-KtxImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`WITH_KTXIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum Plugins. To use as a dynamic
plugin, load @cpp "KtxImporter" @ce via @ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_KTXIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::KtxImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `KtxImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package in CMake and link to the `MagnumPlugins::KtxImporter`
target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED KtxImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::KtxImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-KtxImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

Imports images in the following formats:

-   KTX2 with all uncompressed Vulkan formats that have an equivalent in
    @ref PixelFormat, with component swizzling as necessary
-   KTX2 with most compressed Vulkan formats that have an equivalent in
    @ref CompressedPixelFormat. None of the 3D ASTC formats are supported.

With compressed pixel formats, the image will not be flipped if the Y- or
Z-axis orientation doesn't match the output orientation. The nontrivial amount
of work involved with flipping block-compressed data makes this unfeasible. The
import will succeed but a warning will be emitted.

The importer recognizes @ref ImporterFlag::Verbose, printing additional info
when the flag is enabled.

@subsection Trade-KtxImporter-behavior-types Image types

All image types supported by KTX2 are imported, including 1D, 2D, cube maps,
and 3D images. They can, in turn, all have multiple array layers as well as
multiple mip levels. The image type can be determined from @ref texture() and
@ref TextureData::type().

For layered images and (layered) cube maps, the array layers and faces are
exposed as an additional image dimension. 1D array textures import
@ref ImageData2D with n y-slices, (layered) 2D textures and cube maps import
@ref ImageData3D with 6*n z-slices. 3D array textures behave differently:
because there is no `ImageData4D`, each layer is imported as a separate
@ref ImageData3D, with @ref image3DCount() determining the number of layers.

@subsection Trade-KtxImporter-behavior-multilevel Multilevel images

Files with multiple mip levels are imported with the largest level first, with
the size of each following level divided by 2, rounded down. Mip chains can be
incomplete, ie. they don't have to extend all the way down to a level of size
1x1.

@subsection Trade-KtxImporter-behavior-cube Cube maps

Cube map faces are imported in the order +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z as seen from a
left-handed coordinate system (+X is right, +Y is up, +Z is forward). Layered
cube maps are stored as multiple sets of faces, ie. all faces +X through -Z for
the first layer, then all faces of the second layer, etc.

Incomplete cube maps (determined by the `KTXcubemapIncomplete` metadata entry)
are imported as a 2D array image, but information about which faces it contains
can't be imported.

@subsection Trade-KtxImporter-behavior-supercompression Supercompression

Importing files with [supercompression](https://github.khronos.org/KTX-Specification/#supercompressionSchemes)
is not supported.

@subsection Trade-KtxImporter-behavior-swizzle Swizzle support

Explicit swizzling via the KTXswizzle header entry supports BGR and BGRA. Any
other non-identity channel remapping is unsupported and results in an error.

For reasons similar to the restriction on axis-flips, compressed formats don't
support any swizzling, and the import fails if an image with a compressed
format contains a swizzle that isn't RGBA.
