Supports [Basis Universal](https://github.com/binomialLLC/basis_universal)
compressed images (`*.basis` or `*.ktx2`) by parsing and transcoding files into
an explicitly specified GPU format (see @ref Trade-BasisImporter-target-format).
You can use @ref BasisImageConverter to transcode images into this format.

This plugin provides `BasisImporterEacR`, `BasisImporterEacRG`,
`BasisImporterEtc1RGB`, `BasisImporterEtc2RGBA`, `BasisImporterBc1RGB`,
`BasisImporterBc3RGBA`, `BasisImporterBc4R`, `BasisImporterBc5RG`,
`BasisImporterBc7RGBA`, `BasisImporterPvrtc1RGB4bpp`,
`BasisImporterPvrtc1RGBA4bpp`, `BasisImporterAstc4x4RGBA`, `BasisImporterRGBA8`.

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the
    [Basis Universal GPU Texture Codec](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal)
    library, licensed under @m_class{m-label m-success} **Apache-2.0**
    ([license text](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0),

@section Trade-BasisImporter-usage Usage

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade and [Basis Universal](https://github.com/binomialLLC/basis_universal)
libraries and is built if `WITH_BASISIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum
Plugins. To use as a dynamic plugin, load @cpp "BasisImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager. Current version of the plugin is tested
against the [`v1_15_update2` tag](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/tree/v1_15_update2),
but could possibly compile against newer versions as well.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and
[basis-universal](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal) repositories
and do the following:

@code{.cmake}
set(BASIS_UNIVERSAL_DIR ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/basis-universal)
set(WITH_BASISIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::BasisImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
and [FindBasisUniversal.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindBasisUniversal.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `BasisImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package  and link to the `MagnumPlugins::BasisImporter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED BasisImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::BasisImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-BasisImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

@subsection Trade-BasisImporter-behavior-types Image types

You can import all image types supported by `basisu`: (layered) 2D images,
(layered) cube maps, 3D images and videos. They can in turn all have multiple
mip levels. The image type can be determined from @ref texture() and
@ref TextureData::type().

For layered 2D images and (layered) cube maps, the array layers and faces are
exposed as an additional image dimension. @ref image3D() will return an
@ref ImageData3D with n z-slices, or 6*n z-slices for cube maps.

All 3D images will be imported as 2D array textures with as many layers as
depth slices. This unifies the behaviour with Basis compressed KTX2 files that
don't support 3D images in the first place, and avoids confusing behaviour with
mip levels which are always 2-dimensional in Basis compressed images.

Video files will be imported as multiple 2D images with the same size and level
count. Due to the way video is encoded by Basis Universal, seeking to arbitrary
frames is not allowed. If you call @ref image2D() with non-sequential frame
indices and that frame is not an I-frame, it will print an error and fail.
Restarting from frame 0 is always allowed.

@subsection Trade-BasisImporter-behavior-multilevel Multilevel images

Files with multiple mip levels are imported with the largest level first, with
the size of each following level divided by 2, rounded down. Mip chains can be
incomplete, ie. they don't have to extend all the way down to a level of size
1x1.

Because mip levels in `.basis` files are always 2-dimensional, they wouldn't
halve correctly in the z-dimension for 3D images. If a 3D image with mip levels
is detected, it gets imported as a layered 2D image instead, along with a
warning being printed.

@subsection Trade-BasisImporter-behavior-cube Cube maps

Cube map faces are imported in the order +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z as seen from a
left-handed coordinate system (+X is right, +Y is up, +Z is forward). Layered
cube maps are stored as multiple sets of faces, ie. all faces +X through -Z for
the first layer, then all faces of the second layer, etc.

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par Y-flipping
    While all importers for uncompressed image data are performing a Y-flip on
    import to have the origin at the bottom (as expected by OpenGL), it's a
    non-trivial operation with compressed images. In case of Basis, you can
    pass a `-y_flip` flag to the `basisu` tool to Y-flip the image
    * *during encoding*, however right now there's no way do so on import. To
    inform the user, the importer checks for the Y-flip flag in the file and if
    it's not there, prints a warning about the data having wrong orientation.
@par
    To account for this on the application side for files that you don't have
    control over, flip texture coordinates of the mesh or patch texture data
    loading in the shader.

@section Trade-BasisImporter-configuration Plugin-specific configuration

Basis allows configuration of the format of loaded compressed data.
The full form of the configuration is shown below:

@snippet MagnumPlugins/BasisImporter/BasisImporter.conf configuration_

See @ref plugins-configuration for more information and an example showing how
to edit the configuration values.

@subsection Trade-BasisImporter-target-format Target format

Basis is a compressed format that is *transcoded* into a compressed GPU format.
With @ref BasisImporter, this format can be chosen in different ways:

@snippet BasisImporter.cpp target-format-suffix

The list of valid suffixes is equivalent to enum value names in
@ref TargetFormat. If you want to be able to change the target format
dynamically, you may want to set the `format` configuration of the plugin, as
shown below. If you instantiate this class directly without a plugin manager,
you may also use @ref setTargetFormat().

@snippet BasisImporter.cpp target-format-config

There are many options and you should generally be striving for the
highest-quality format available on a given platform. A detailed description of
the choices can be found in the [Basis Universal Wiki](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/wiki/How-to-Deploy-ETC1S-Texture-Content-Using-Basis-Universal).
As an example, the following code is a decision making used by
@ref magnum-player "magnum-player" based on availability of corresponding
OpenGL, OpenGL ES and WebGL extensions, in its full ugly glory:

@snippet BasisImporter.cpp gl-extension-checks

@subsection Trade-BasisImporter-compile-size Reducing compile size

To reduce the binary size of the transcoder, Basis Universal supports a set of
preprocessor defines to turn off unneeded features. The Basis Universal Wiki
lists macros to disable specific [target formats](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/wiki/How-to-Use-and-Configure-the-Transcoder#shrinking-the-transcoders-compiled-size)
as well as [KTX2 support](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/wiki/How-to-Use-and-Configure-the-Transcoder#disabling-ktx2-or-zstandard-usage).
If you're building it from source with `BASIS_UNIVERSAL_DIR` set, add the
desired defines before adding `magnum-plugins` as a subfolder:

@code{.cmake}
add_definitions(
    -DBASISD_SUPPORT_BC7=0
    -DBASISD_SUPPORT_KTX2=0)

# ...
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
@endcode
